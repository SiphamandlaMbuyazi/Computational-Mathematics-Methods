README!
To succesfully run this script you have to do the following

install packages: numpy and fpdf(for writting onto the pdf)

to install all the above you have to have pip installed on your machine

then run `pip install numpy, fpdf`

after this you can then run the scripts no problem using python3 q3final.py

if there's a problem with this I have pre-ran the script and on this folder there's results folder which already contains the results
